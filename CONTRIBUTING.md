## Making changes

  * Bug? Open an issue.
  * Request? Open an issue and ask. Saves wasting your time making changes that will be denied for being bad or unwanted.

When contributing, make a merge request with a clear list of what you've done.

Write clear commit messages. One line is fine for smaller changes, or multiple lines for bigger changes. Be clear and concise.

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Read the code to understand, but basically:

  * [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) style for the most part, with some modifications.
  * TAB for indentation.
  * Please include comments.

Thanks,
Tom
